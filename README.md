## Features

- **Common Suffix Testing**: Automatically tests common domain suffixes (e.g., `.com`, `.org`, `.net`) to find valid IPv4 addresses.
- **Full Suffix Testing**: Tests all possible domain suffixes (*in its database*) to ensure thorough coverage.
- **Acceleration Mode**: Offers an accelerated mode to speed up the testing process, though users should be aware of potential ISP violations.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive command-line interface for easy use.
- **Clear Output**: Provides clear and concise output of resolved IPv4 addresses.

## Installation

1. **Download the Script**:

## Usage

1. **Enter Domain Name or URL**:
   - When prompted, enter the domain name or URL you want to resolve.
   - Example: `example.com` **or** `example` (*if you want to look for the suffix of a domain.*)

2. **Test Common Suffixes**:
   - If no domain suffix is detected, you will be prompted to test common suffixes first (This is helpful if you can't remember a URL!).
   - Example: `Y` to test common suffixes.

3. **Test All Suffixes**:
   - If no valid IPs are found with common suffixes, you can choose to test all possible suffixes.
   - Example: `Y` to test all suffixes.
